# Kawaii To Go

## Overview

###	My capstone project is based on one of my hobbies of watching various cute computer set-up videos that had various accessories and conveniences but one question always comes to mind. Where can I find these items ? Sure Amazon has a lot of products but where do I know that I’ll find these items?  Well look no further because this site is intended to be the answer to that problem! Introducing KawaiiToGo! (The term “Kawaii” is a popular term in social media that stands for “cute” in Japanese)

###	KawaiiToGo is intended to be a “cute Amazon” where people can hop on and expect to find and order cute products from small business owners and companies. From cat eared headphones and plushies to anime figurines and table sets, just about everything you could desire will very much be just within reach at the tip of your fingers to start or compliment your aesthetic layout!  Naturally while this product may appeal highly to young girls to young adults, I also want to incorporate cool items for instance mangas and anime figurines that are beloved by both genders and seen as collectables! Naturally with this website being made to help people collect to improve their aesthetic, this website is intended to have a mixture of a cool yet cute design layout with its own assistant mascots made from scratch (since the website is intended to be made for fun, if I can’t copyright them then it doesn’t really matter besides the experience). It’s also supposed to be functionable for both computer and mobile.

### The defining functions for this product will be a shopper’s home page, shopping cart, search filter, purchase system, order tracking system ( if doable ), and check-out history system
